## Access

All Enumerations (Enums) are defined **globally** as tables. You can access their members directly using the Enum name, followed by either the dot (`.`) operator or the bracket (`[]`) operator and the desired value name.

```lua Enum Usage Example
local draw_event_type = EventType.Draw; -- Dot Operator
local visuals_global_type = GlobalType["Visuals"]; -- Bracket Operator
```

## EventType

This enumeration lists the available event triggers that scripts can register functions to handle using the **`event.set`** function.

<ParamField path="Tick" type="number"> Triggered on tick fired **`(10ms)`**.</ParamField>
<ParamField path="Heartbeat" type="number"> Triggered on heartbeat fired **`(1000ms)`**.</ParamField>
<ParamField path="Join" type="number"> Triggered when a new entry is registered.</ParamField>
<ParamField path="Leave" type="number"> Triggered when a registered entry has left the game.</ParamField>
<ParamField path="Unload" type="number"> Triggered when all scripts or the software is unloaded.</ParamField>

## GlobalType

This enumeration lists the available global section types that you can use with the **`menu.set_global`** and **`menu.get_global`** functions.

<ParamField path="Ignore" type="number"> Ignored miscellaneous section used for storing Alpha / Shift.</ParamField>
<ParamField path="Assist" type="number"> The assist section used for storing the Assist page globals.</ParamField>
<ParamField path="PlayersEnemy" type="number"> The enemy players section used for storing the Players->Enemies page globals.</ParamField>
<ParamField path="PlayersFriends" type="number"> The friend players section used for storing the Players->Friendlies page globals.</ParamField>
<ParamField path="PlayersClient" type="number"> The client players section used for storing the Players->Client page globals.</ParamField>

<ParamField path="Style" type="number"> The style section used for storing the Style window globals.</ParamField>
<ParamField path="Settings" type="number"> The settings section used for storing the Config window globals.</ParamField>

## ModelFlags

This enumeration defines various binary flags used to represent the current state or properties of a ModelObject for checking in Lua scripts. These flags can be checked against a ModelObject's Flags property using the bitwise AND operator (`&`).

<ParamField path="Visible" type="number"> Flag indicating that the model is currently not transparent (Visible).</ParamField>
<ParamField path="Godded" type="number"> Flag indicating that the model is in a 'God Mode' or invulnerable state.</ParamField>
<ParamField path="Ragdoll" type="number"> Flag indicating that the model is currently in a ragdoll or collapsed physics state.</ParamField>
<ParamField path="Forcefield" type="number"> Flag indicating that the model is protected by a forcefield.</ParamField>
<ParamField path="Undamaged" type="number"> Flag indicating that the model has not yet taken any damage.</ParamField>
<ParamField path="Dead" type="number"> Flag indicating that the model is currently dead.</ParamField>
<ParamField path="Tool" type="number"> Flag indicating that the model is currently holding a tool.</ParamField>
<ParamField path="Void" type="number"> Flag indicating that the model is outside of the Workspace service (Primitive Nulled out).</ParamField>

## EntryExclude

This enumeration defines flags used to specify which types of entries should be excluded or filtered when retrieving the entry list.

<ParamField path="None" type="number"> Does not exclude any entries; returns all entries regardless of their current state (e.g., even if they are in a removing state).</ParamField>
<ParamField path="Valid" type="number"> Excludes entries that are currently in a removing or invalid state, returning only actively loaded entries.</ParamField>
<ParamField path="Model" type="number"> Excludes entries that do not have an associated ModelObject, returning only entries with a ModelObject.</ParamField>
