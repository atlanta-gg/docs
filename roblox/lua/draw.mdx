## Access

All draw C++ functions are exposed to your Lua script via a single global table named **`draw`**. You access individual values by using the dot (`.`) or bracket (`[]`) operator on this table.

```lua Draw Usage Example
event.set(EventType.Draw, function()
	draw.line(Rect.new(10, 10, 200, 250), Color4.new(1, 0, 0, 1)); -- Dot Operator
	draw["rect_filled"](Rect.new(Vector2.new(20, 30), Vector2.new(150, 215)), Color4.new(0, 0, 1, 1), 2.5); -- Bracket Operator
end);
```

## Functions

This section lists all available C++ functions exposed within the global **`draw`** table. These functions provide low-level access to the graphics engine, enabling direct rendering of various elements like shapes, lines, text, and images to the screen.
