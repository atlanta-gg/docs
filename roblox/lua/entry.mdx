## Access

All entry C++ functions are exposed to your Lua script via a single global table named **`entry`**. You access individual values by using the dot (`.`) or bracket (`[]`) operator on this table.

```lua Entry Usage Example
local entry_client_instance = entry.get_client_instance(); -- Dot Operator
local entry_client_object = entry["get"](entry_client_instance); -- Bracket Operator
```

---

## valid

Checks if the provided Entry object is currently valid and active (not in a removal state).

```lua
valid(EntryObject*: entry, bool?: model): bool
```

<ParamField path="entry" type="EntryObject*" required> The **EntryObject** instance (shared pointer) to be validated.</ParamField>
<ParamField path="model" type="boolean"> If `true`, the function performs an additional check to ensure the entry has a valid **ModelObject**. Defaults to `false`.</ParamField>

---

## list

Retrieves a Lua table containing the currently active list of Entry objects. The list can be filtered based on the optional exclusion flags.

```lua
list(EntryExclude?: exclude): table<EntryObject*>
```

<ParamField path="exclude" type="EntryExclude">A flag from the **EntryExclude** enumeration specifying which types of entries should be filtered out. Defaults to `EntryExclude.None` (no filtering).</ParamField>

---

## get

Retrieves a specific EntryObject instance based on its player object address.

```lua
get(address: number): EntryObject*
```

<ParamField path="address" type="number" required>The player object number address of the EntryObject to retrieve.</ParamField>

---

## get_root

Retrieves the root PartObject associated with a given entrie's player object address.

```lua
get_root(address: number): PartObject*
```

<ParamField path="address" type="number" required>The player object number address of the entry whose root object is requested.</ParamField>

---

## get_client_instance

Returns the local client's player instance address.

```lua
get_client_instance(): EntryObject*
```

---

## get_client_team

Returns the local client's team instance address.

```lua
get_client_team(): number
```

---

## get_tick_count

Returns the current entry thread tick count.

```lua
get_tick_count(): number
```

---

## get_model_tick_count

Returns the current model thread tick count.

```lua
get_model_tick_count(): number
```

---

## get_entry_count

Returns the total number of entries currently loaded in the game environment.

```lua
get_entry_count(): number
```
