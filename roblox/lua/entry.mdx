## Access

All C++ functions are exposed to your Lua script via a single global table named **`entry`**. You access individual values by using the dot (`.`) or bracket (`[]`) operator on this table.

```lua
local entry_client_instance = entry.get_client_instance(); -- Dot Operator
local entry_client_object = entry["get"](entry_client_instance); -- Bracket Operator
```

## valid

> **Signature:** `valid(entry: EntryObject*, model: boolean | nil): boolean`

<Summary>Checks if the provided Entry object is currently valid and active (not in a removal state). If the optional `model` argument is set to `true`, it also verifies that the entry has an associated model object.</Summary>
