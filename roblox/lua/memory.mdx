## Access

All memory C++ functions are exposed to your Lua script via a single global table named **`memory`**. You access individual values by using the dot (`.`) or bracket (`[]`) operator on this table.

```lua Memory Usage Example
local memory_read_bytes = memory.read_bytes(0x7FF72D040000, (100 * 8)); -- Dot Operator
memory["write_uint64"](0x7FF72D040000, constants["uint64_max"]); -- Bracket Operator
```
