## Access

All input C++ functions are exposed to your Lua script via a single global table named **`input`**. You access individual values by using the dot (`.`) or bracket (`[]`) operator on this table.

```lua Input Usage Example
input.mouse_right_click(); -- Dot Operator
local input_mouse_location = input["get_mouse_location"](); -- Bracket Operator
```

---

## Functions

This section lists all available C++ functions exposed within the global **`input`** table. These functions are used to simulate and manage system-level interactions, including mouse movement, button clicks, and keyboard key presses.

### mouse_move_relative

Moves the mouse cursor relative to its current position.

```lua
mouse_move_relative(number: x, number: y): void
```

<ParamField path="x" type="number" required>The horizontal distance to move the cursor in pixels.</ParamField>
