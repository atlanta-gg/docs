## Access

All Types (UserTypes) are exposed to the Lua environment as globally available constructors. You can create new instances or manipulate existing ones using the constructor name, followed by the dot (`.`) to access their properties and the colon (`:`) operator to call self methods.

```lua Types Usage Example
local cframe_type = CFrame.new(Vector3.new(10, 5, 8)); -- Dot Operator
local cframe_degrees = cframe_type:getXYZYPRDegrees(); -- Colon Operator
```

## Members

This section lists all globally available **Custom Data Structures (Types)**. These are exposed as constructors (e.g., `Vector3.new()`) and contain various properties, functions and methods (`:method()`) essential for working with game and graphics data.
