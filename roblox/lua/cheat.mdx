<Danger>Many functions within the `cheat` table are designed to operate exclusively on a specific class of game instance (e.g., `set_ambient` only works on a **`Lighting`** instance). You are responsible for ensuring that the instance you pass as an argument is of the correct class type *before* calling the function. Passing an incorrect instance type will lead to undefined behavior, errors, or application crashes.</Danger>

---

## Access

All cheat C++ functions are exposed to your Lua script via a single global table named **`cheat`**. You access individual values by using the dot (`.`) or bracket (`[]`) operator on this table.

```lua Cheat Usage Example
local instance_name = cheat.get_name(instance); -- Dot Operator
cheat["set_field_of_view"](camera, 20); -- Bracket Operator
```

## Functions

This section lists all available C++ functions exposed within the global **`cheat`** table. These functions provide high-level manipulation and access to environment, game state, and object properties.

---

### world_to_point

Converts a 3D world position to a 2D screen point. Returns a Point containing the screen position and offscreen state.

```lua
world_to_point(Vector3: value, boolean?: offscreen): Point
```

<ParamField path="value" type="Vector3" required>The 3D world position to convert to screen coordinates.</ParamField>
<ParamField path="offscreen" type="boolean">Whether to calculate the position when it's offscreen. If `false`, returns a Point with `visible` set to `false` when offscreen without calculating the actual position. Defaults to `false`.</ParamField>

### get_data_model

Gets the current DataModel instance address. Returns the memory address as a number.

```lua
get_data_model(): number
```

---

### get_render_view

Gets the current Render View address. Returns the memory address as a number.

```lua
get_render_view(): number
```

---

### get_engine

Gets the current Visual Engine address. Returns the memory address as a number.

```lua
get_engine(): number
```

---

### get_service

Gets a service from the service list by name. Returns the memory address as a number.

```lua
get_service(string: name): number
```

<ParamField path="name" type="string" required>The name of the service to retrieve (e.g., `"Players"`, `"UserInputService"`).</ParamField>

### get_workspace

Gets the current Workspace instance address. Returns the memory address as a number.

```lua
get_workspace(): number
```

---

### get_game_id

Gets the current game's game ID. Returns the game ID as a number.

```lua
get_game_id(number: address): number
```

<ParamField path="address" type="number" required>The DataModel instance address.</ParamField>

### get_place_id

Gets the current game's place ID. Returns the place ID as a number.

```lua
get_place_id(number: address): number
```

<ParamField path="address" type="number" required>The DataModel instance address.</ParamField>

### get_tick

Gets the current game's tick count. Returns the tick count as a number.

```lua
get_tick(number: address): number
```

<ParamField path="address" type="number" required>The DataModel instance address.</ParamField>

### get_job_id

Gets the current game's job ID. Returns the job ID as a string. Can be called with a DataModel address or without arguments to retrieve the cached job ID.

```lua
get_job_id(number?: address): string
```

<ParamField path="address" type="number">The DataModel instance address. If not provided, returns the cached job ID.</ParamField>

### get_version

Gets the target process's current version. Returns the version string.

```lua
get_version(): string
```

### get_time

Gets the current time from the Visual Engine. Returns the time as a number.

```lua
get_time(number: address): number
```

<ParamField path="address" type="number" required>The Visual Engine address.</ParamField>

### get_matrix

Gets the view matrix from the Visual Engine. Returns a Matrix4 containing the current view transformation.

```lua
get_matrix(number: address): Matrix4
```

<ParamField path="address" type="number" required>The Visual Engine address.</ParamField>

### set_lighting_state

Sets the lighting update state for the Render View. Controls whether lighting, sky, or both are updated.

```lua
set_lighting_state(number: address, number: value)
```

<ParamField path="address" type="number" required>The Render View instance address.</ParamField>
<ParamField path="value" type="number" required>The lighting state value: `0x0` for both lighting and sky updates, `0x100` for sky updates only, or `0x1` for lighting updates only.</ParamField>

### set_sky_state

Sets the sky update state for the Render View. Should be called after writing to skybox along with `set_lighting_state`.

```lua
set_sky_state(number: address, boolean: value)
```

<ParamField path="address" type="number" required>The Render View instance address.</ParamField>
<ParamField path="value" type="boolean" required>The sky state value. Set to `false` to trigger sky updates.</ParamField>

### set_fflag

Sets a Fast Flag (FFlag) value by name. Returns `true` if the flag was successfully set, `false` otherwise.

```lua
set_fflag(string: name, boolean | number: value): boolean
```

<ParamField path="name" type="string" required>The name of the Fast Flag to set.</ParamField>
<ParamField path="value" type="boolean | number" required>The value to set the flag to. Accepts boolean or number types. String support coming in the future.</ParamField>

<Tip>For rapid identification, reading an instance's **Class Name** (`get_class`) is highly recommended over reading its user-defined Name (`get_name`). `get_class` requires only **one low-level memory read** per instance, offering significantly better performance and should be the preferred method for filtering and iteration in your scripts.</Tip>

---

### get_class

Gets the class name of an Instance. Returns the class name as a string.

```lua
get_class(number: address): string
```

<ParamField path="address" type="number" required>The Instance address to get the class name from.</ParamField>

### get_parent

Gets the parent Instance of an Instance. Returns the parent Instance address as a number.

```lua
get_parent(number: address): number
```

<ParamField path="address" type="number" required>The Instance address to get the parent from.</ParamField>

### get_name

Gets the name of an Instance. Returns the name as a string.

```lua
get_name(number: address): string
```

<ParamField path="address" type="number" required>The Instance address to get the name from.</ParamField>
