<Danger>Many functions within the `cheat` table are designed to operate exclusively on a specific class of game instance (e.g., `set_ambient` only works on a **`Lighting`** instance). You are responsible for ensuring that the instance you pass as an argument is of the correct class type *before* calling the function. Passing an incorrect instance type will lead to undefined behavior, errors, or application crashes.</Danger>

## Access

All cheat C++ functions are exposed to your Lua script via a single global table named **`cheat`**. You access individual values by using the dot (`.`) or bracket (`[]`) operator on this table.

```lua Cheat Usage Example
local instance_name = cheat.get_name(instance); -- Dot Operator
cheat["set_field_of_view"](camera, 20); -- Bracket Operator
```

## Functions

This section lists all available C++ functions exposed within the global **`cheat`** table. These functions provide high-level manipulation and access to environment, game state, and object properties.
