<Note>Our Lua is a custom Lua 5.4 environment, not a script executor. It's a secure environment with special functions and features from our cheat embedded directly into it.</Note>

## Still Having Issues?

We're committed to helping you fix any issues you encounter. If the documentation and Lua functions don't provide a solution, please reach out to us by opening a ticket on our Discord server.
