## Bridge

This section lists errors related to the driver initialization, kernel mapping, and communication bridge processes.

### Description

These errors indicate that the system is **actively blocking** the software's attempt to load or communicate with its kernel driver. This is typically due to strict system security policies or external software interference.

**Affected Modules:** `Bridge User Handle`, `Driver Init`, `Bridge User Handle Close`, `Map Kernel Base`, `Bridge Status`, `Bridge Init`, `Threads Init`

### Resolution

To resolve these errors, you must disable any software or system features that interfere with low-level driver loading and memory access:

1.  **Temporarily Disable Antivirus:** Completely disable any third-party antivirus, anticheat, or firewall software running on your system.
2.  **Disable Windows Security Features:** Ensure that Windows' built-in security features are turned off:
    * **Memory Integrity / HVCI:** Disable this in Windows Security.
    * **Core Isolation:** Disable this setting.
    * **Windows Defender/Security:** Temporarily pause real-time protection.
3.  **Check Driver Blocklist:** If the issue persists, your operating system may be using a driver blocklist policy (often enforced by strict Memory Integrity settings). You must ensure these settings are disabled and the system is rebooted.

## Scanning

This section lists all core memory scanning and initialization errors.

### Description

If you encounter any of the errors listed below, it indicates that the software failed to locate or initialize critical memory offsets within the target application. These errors occur when the structure of the game's executable has changed, making existing scan patterns invalid.

**Affected Scan Points:** `Datamodel Init`, `Services Init`, `Datamodel Pointer`, `Render View Pointer`, `Visual Engine Pointer`, `Base Init`

### Resolution

To resolve these errors, ensure the following steps are taken in order:

1.  **Update the Software:** Verify that you are running the absolute latest version of the Atlanta client.
2.  **Game Version Check:** Confirm that your target game is fully updated to the current public build.
3.  **Channel Mismatch:** If both the client and game are updated, you may have been pushed to a non-standard or experimental game channel. To fix this, you must **revert your game client** to the known, current stable version.
