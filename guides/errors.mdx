## Application Permissions

### Description

This error occurs when the Atlanta client software is executed without the necessary **Administrator permissions**. Due to the nature of the software's operations (including low-level driver loading, kernel communication, and process memory access), elevated privileges are required for the application to function correctly.

### Resolution

To resolve this issue, you must ensure the Atlanta client is always launched with administrative rights:

1.  **Close Client:** Close all running instances of the Atlanta client.
2.  **Right-Click Launch:** Locate the Atlanta client executable file. Right-click on it and select **"Run as administrator."**
3.  **Permanent Fix (Optional):** To avoid this error in the future, right-click the executable, go to **Properties** -> **Compatibility** tab, and check the box that says **"Run this program as an administrator."** Click **Apply** and **OK**.

## Anti Cheat Process Open

### Description

This error indicates that the Atlanta client has detected another active **kernel-level anti-cheat (AC) process** running on your system. The Atlanta client cannot be injected while another AC is active (e.g., **Vanguard**, **Easy Anti-Cheat (EAC)**, **FACEIT AC**, or **Ricochet**), as their low-level kernel drivers will conflict, potentially leading to instability or system crashes.

### Resolution

To proceed, you must completely close or uninstall the interfering anti-cheat software:

1.  **Identify and Close:** Close any games or applications that use a kernel-level anti-cheat.
2.  **Task Manager Check:** Open your **Task Manager** (Ctrl+Shift+Esc) and check for known anti-cheat services running in the background.
3.  **Disable/Uninstall:** If the AC is running as a permanent service (like Vanguard), you may need to temporarily disable or uninstall the anti-cheat software and **reboot your PC** before attempting to load the Atlanta client again.

## Process Already Open

### Description

This error occurs when the system detects **more than one handle** or instance of the Atlanta client process running simultaneously. The software is designed to run as a single instance and will not load if a previous instance is still active in the background.

### Resolution

To fix this, ensure all instances of the client are completely closed:

1.  **Close Client:** Close the Atlanta client application window.
2.  **Task Manager Check:** Open your **Task Manager** (Ctrl+Shift+Esc).
3.  **End Process:** Check the **Details** or **Processes** tab and forcibly end any remaining processes related to the **Atlanta client**.
4.  **Relaunch:** Relaunch the Atlanta client.

---

## Multiple Handles

### Description

This error indicates that the software has detected **multiple active instances or handles** of the target game client (e.g., the Roblox client) running simultaneously. The Atlanta software requires the game to be running as a single, unique instance to ensure proper memory access and stability.

### Resolution

To resolve this, you must ensure only one instance of the game is running:

1.  **Close All Game Windows:** Manually close all open windows related to the target game.
2.  **Task Manager Check:** Open your **Task Manager** (Ctrl+Shift+Esc).
3.  **End Game Processes:** Navigate to the **Details** or **Processes** tab and forcibly end any remaining background processes associated with the game client executable (e.g., `RobloxPlayerBeta.exe`).
4.  **Relaunch:** Relaunch the game and then attempt to load the Atlanta client.

## Game Process Not Found

### Description

This error group indicates that the Atlanta client was unable to locate or obtain critical identifying information for the target game process, or that the process closed unexpectedly during the load sequence.

**Affected Scan Points:** `Process ID`, `Process Handle`, `Process Version`

### Resolution

This issue is typically caused by a timing error or an incorrect game state. Ensure the following steps are followed precisely:

1.  **Game State:** Verify that your target game is fully **open and running** *before* pressing the **Load** button in the Atlanta client.
2.  **Loader Selection:** Double-check that you have selected the correct game profile in the loader interface.
3.  **Relaunch Sequence:** If the error persists, completely close both the Atlanta client and the game, reboot your PC, and then attempt the load process again.

---

## Permissions

### Description

This error indicates a failure during the authentication phase. It is triggered by one of three possible scenarios:

1.  **Authentication Server Down:** The Atlanta authentication servers are temporarily unavailable or unreachable.
2.  **Invalid Credentials:** The locally stored username and password in your configuration files (`C:\atlanta\storage.json`) are incorrect or have expired.
3.  **HWID Mismatch:** Your current system hardware ID (HWID) does not match the HWID linked to your account.

### Resolution

To resolve this issue, you must force the loader to re-authenticate:

1.  **Close Client:** Fully close the Atlanta client application.
2.  **Relaunch and Re-authenticate:** Relaunch the Atlanta client and log in again using your correct username and password. This action will refresh the stored credentials and attempt to reconnect to the authentication server, simultaneously checking your current HWID.
3.  **Contact Support (HWID):** If the error persists, especially after confirming correct credentials, you may need to **contact support** to request an HWID reset.

## Bridge

This section lists errors related to the driver initialization, kernel mapping, and communication bridge processes.

### Description

These errors indicate that the system is **actively blocking** the software's attempt to load or communicate with its kernel driver. This is typically due to strict system security policies or external software interference.

**Affected Modules:** `Bridge User Handle`, `Driver Init`, `Bridge User Handle Close`, `Map Kernel Base`, `Bridge Status`, `Bridge Init`, `Threads Init`

### Resolution

To resolve these errors, you must disable any software or system features that interfere with low-level driver loading and memory access:

1.  **Temporarily Disable Antivirus:** Completely disable any third-party antivirus, anticheat, or firewall software running on your system.
2.  **Disable Windows Security Features:** Ensure that Windows' built-in security features are turned off:
    * **Memory Integrity / HVCI:** Disable this in Windows Security.
    * **Core Isolation:** Disable this setting.
    * **Windows Defender/Security:** Temporarily pause real-time protection.
3.  **Check Driver Blocklist:** If the issue persists, your operating system may be using a driver blocklist policy (often enforced by strict Memory Integrity settings). You must ensure these settings are disabled and the system is rebooted.

## Scanning

This section lists all core memory scanning and initialization errors.

### Description

If you encounter any of the errors listed below, it indicates that the software failed to locate or initialize critical memory offsets within the target application. These errors occur when the structure of the game's executable has changed, making existing scan patterns invalid.

**Affected Scan Points:** `Datamodel Init`, `Services Init`, `Datamodel Pointer`, `Render View Pointer`, `Visual Engine Pointer`, `Map Init`, `Base Init`

### Resolution

To resolve these errors, ensure the following steps are taken in order:

1.  **Update the Software:** Verify that you are running the absolute latest version of the Atlanta client.
2.  **Game Version Check:** Confirm that your target game is fully updated to the current public build.
3.  **Channel Mismatch:** If both the client and game are updated, you may have been pushed to a non-standard or experimental game channel. To fix this, you must **revert your game client** to the known, current stable version.

## Configuration

### Description

This group of errors indicates a failure in reading, writing, or accessing essential local configuration files. This interference prevents the Atlanta client from loading, saving, or applying your user settings and theme.

**Affected Modules/Files:** `Config Init`, `Config Path`, `Theme Path`, `Settings Path`, `Config File`, `Config Save`, `Config File Delete`, `Config Delete`, `Config Refresh`, `Theme File`, `Settings File`, `Bind Init`, **`Config Parse`**

### Non-Fatal Error

**`Config Parse`**

This specific error is non-fatal and occurs when you attempt to **load an existing configuration file** that is either **corrupted** or contains an **invalid data format**.

### Resolution

These issues are almost universally caused by external applications locking or blocking access to the `C:\atlanta` directory. To resolve the main errors, disable or pause any software that controls file integrity, syncing, or real-time protection:

1.  **File Syncing Software:** Completely disable or temporarily pause applications like **OneDrive**, Google Drive Sync, or Dropbox that monitor the user's hard drive folders.
2.  **Antivirus Interference:** Temporarily disable your **Antivirus** or any **Windows Security** features (like Controlled Folder Access) that might be locking the configuration directory.
3.  **Permissions:** Ensure the Atlanta client and the game have full read/write permissions for the `C:\atlanta` folder. If necessary, delete the folder, run the client as administrator once, and allow it to recreate the file structure.
