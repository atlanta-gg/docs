## Lost Menu Keybind

If you closed the initial setup window before reassigning a menu key and are now unable to open the menu using the default **INSERT** key:

1.  Open **File Explorer**.
2.  Navigate to your system drive, typically **`C:\`** (e.g., `This PC` -> `Local Disk (C:)`).
3.  Browse to the Atlanta configuration folder: **`C:\atlanta`** $\rightarrow$ **`<Selected Product Subfolder>`** (e.g., the folder named after the game).
4.  Locate the file named **`settings.json`**.
5.  **Right-click** on `settings.json` and select **Delete** or **Permanently Delete**.
6.  **Relaunch the Atlanta client.**

This action resets the local settings and will prompt the setup window again upon the next client launch.

## Persistent 'Multiple Handles' Error

If you repeatedly encounter the "Multiple Handles" error (which applies to the game client):

1.  Open the **Task Manager** (Ctrl + Shift + Esc).
2.  Navigate to the **Details** tab at the top.
3.  Scroll down to the letter 'R' and locate the game process: **`RobloxPlayerBeta.exe`**.
4.  **Right-click** and select **End task** on *all* instances of `RobloxPlayerBeta.exe` listed.
5.  **Relaunch the Atlanta client.**

## Inaccurate Waypoint Saving

Waypoint coordinates are saved by rounding and converting floating-point numbers to integers, which can lead to precision loss.

**Workaround:**

When saving your waypoints, enable **waypoint visualization** first. Try saving the waypoint from a position that forces the coordinates to be the most accurate for your intended spot (e.g., jump up or move side-to-side slightly) to ensure the integer conversion captures the best possible location.
