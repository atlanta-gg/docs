<Warning>Please immediately save your license key in a secure, private location. In the unlikely event you lose access to your purchase email, discord account or if it is deleted, you will not be able to recover your key through our automated system. Treat this key like a password.</Warning>

## Purchases via Our Website

If you purchased directly through our website, your license key is delivered via email. Check the order completion email sent to the address used during checkout.

<Note>Did not receive your order confirmation? Please check your spam or junk folder, as the email may have been filtered there.</Note>

When searching, look for an email sent from the address platform@billgang.store. It should be easy to spot as the subject or sender often contains atlanta.gg.

After finding the email, simply click the View Order button to proceed and retrieve your license key.

## Purchases via Discord Bot

This section covers purchases made through our official Discord bot using Robux or gift cards.

<Note>Purchases made with Robux are generally instant; however, if ROBLOX is experiencing downtime, confirmation may be delayed by up to a few hours. Gift card purchases are manually processed and approved.</Note>

### For Robux

Upon following through with the Robux purchase panel, you should receive an instant confirmation within the #responses channel.

### For Gift Cards

Upon following through with the Gift Card purchase panel, wait for a confirmation in the #responses channel. The bot will ping you with a message like Gift Card Request Accepted or Gift Card Request Denied once the manual review is complete.
