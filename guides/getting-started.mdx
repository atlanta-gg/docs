## Purchases via Our Website

When searching, look for an email sent from the address platform@billgang.store. It should be easy to spot as the subject or sender often contains atlanta.gg.

## Purchases via Discord Bot

This section covers purchases made through our official Discord bot using Robux or gift cards.

<Note>Purchases made with Robux are generally instant; however, if ROBLOX is experiencing downtime, confirmation may be delayed by up to a few hours. Gift card purchases are manually processed and approved.</Note>

### For Robux

Upon following through with the Robux purchase panel, you should receive an instant confirmation within the #responses channel.
